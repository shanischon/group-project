# EBS Volume - Placeholder
# This file will be implemented by the teammate responsible for "Separate EBS Volume"

# Comment for teammate:
# Please implement the separate EBS volume configuration here.
# Consider including:
# - aws_ebs_volume resource
# - aws_volume_attachment to attach the volume to the EC2 instance
# - Any necessary variables in variables.tf
# - Any necessary outputs in outputs.tf

# The EC2 instance is named aws_instance.cloudify_instance
# You can reference it for volume attachment
